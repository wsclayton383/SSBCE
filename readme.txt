Super Smash Bros. CE
Beta v0.3
By theflamingninja21
TI-84+ CE

I added stocks to the damage GUI, as well as the announcer countdown and "Game!".
Platforms have been added to the test stage.
Bug fixes, optimization, etc.


Controls:
P1
(P2)

Arrow keys:		Move, direct attacks, etc. Double-tap down to fall through platforms.
(4, 5, 6, 8)

2nd:			Neutral attack. Press down just before 2nd to down smash.
(^)

Alpha:		Special attack, which can be cancelled by pressing alpha again. Press while holding up to recover.
(/)

Mode:			Jump. I chose not to use up for jump to make up attacks easier to use.
(tan)

XT0n:			Shield and dodge. Hold to long and your shield will break, and you'll be unable to move until it regenerates.
