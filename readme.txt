Super Smash Bros. CE
Beta v0.1
By theflamingninja21
TI-84+ CE

More of a proof of concept than an actual beta, but I figured I should announce this project before I go any further.

Controls:

Arrow keys: Move, direct attacks, etc.

2nd: Neutral attack. Press down just before 2nd to down smash.

Alpha: Special attack, which can be cancelled by pressing alpha again. Press while holding up to recover.

Mode: Jump. I chose not to use up for jump to make up attacks easier to use.

XT0n: Shield and dodge. Hold to long and your shield will break, and you'll be unable to move until it regenerates.

Clear: Exit.

y=/window (debug): Enables/disables fps and frameskip display.

+,- (debug): Add,subtract damage.
