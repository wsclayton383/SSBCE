Super Smash Bros. CE
Beta v0.2
By theflamingninja21
TI-84+ CE

I added a second character, so attacks finally do something. This pretty much cuts the framerate in half, so v0.3 will be focused on optimization.


Controls:
P1
(P2)

Arrow keys:		Move, direct attacks, etc.
(4, 5, 6, 8)

2nd:			Neutral attack. Press down just before 2nd to down smash.
(^)

Alpha:		Special attack, which can be cancelled by pressing alpha again. Press 				while holding up to recover.
(/)

Mode:			Jump. I chose not to use up for jump to make up attacks easier to use.
(tan)

XT0n:			Shield and dodge. Hold to long and your shield will break, and you'll be 			unable to move until it regenerates.

Clear: Exit.

y=/window (debug): Enables/disables fps and frameskip display, and shows hitboxes.

+,- (debug):	Add,subtract damage.


Changelog:
