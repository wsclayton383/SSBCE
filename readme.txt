Super Smash Bros. CE
v1.1

TI-84+ CE

After being dead for a year, I have returned with an update for you all. Enjoy the two new characters!

Also a more accurate knockback system.


Controls:
P1
(P2)

Arrow keys:		Move, direct attacks, etc. Double-tap down to fall through platforms.
(4, 5, 6, 8)

2nd:			Neutral attack. Press down just before 2nd to down smash.
(^)

Alpha:		Special attack, which can be cancelled by pressing alpha again. Press while holding up to recover.
(/)

Mode:			Jump. I chose not to use up for jump to make up attacks easier to use.
(tan)

XT0n:			Shield and dodge. Hold to long and your shield will break, and you'll be unable to move until it regenerates.
())


Clear: Exit.

y=/window (debug): Enables/disables fps and frameskip display, and shows hitboxes.

+,- (debug):	Add, subtract damage from P1.


Debug controls require debug mode to be enabled in the options menu.

Beta v0.3		Added platforms, stocks, and countdown.
v1.0			Added menu, more stages, options, and moving platforms.
